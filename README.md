## [1] Learing about Algorithms
> Learning about algorithms (sort, search, delete, update, insert and so on)

> Making a little exercise on a basic mathematics algorithms (+, -, /, * and so on)

> Pointers are nothing more than variables that store memory addresses of another variable and can be used to access the value stored at those addresses. Various operators such as *, &, and [], enable us to use pointers.

> Arrays is a data structure used to store multiple data elements of the same data type. All the data is
stored sequentially. The value stored at any index can be accessed in constant time.

> I figured out the difference between printf() and puts() function in displaying things out on the console. puts() works but it works strangely.

> I really tried making use of gets() to take input but it doesnt work for me except i use my regular scanf() which i find confortable as time goes by. 

> I learnt about the atoi() function from the stdlib.h. It helps in taking numbers from string but the rule is that it must start with numbers else it will return 0 as a value.
